## Project Structure

The project is seperated into `server/` and `client/` code bases within the `src/` folder.

Within `server/`, you will find a few folders for database connection and utils (`db/`), controllers for business logic (`controllers/`), functions for express middlewars (`middlewares/`), server routes (`routes/`), and configuration (`config/`).

Within `client/`, you will find the `App.jsx` to start, along with other folders for frontend organization.

Read [Frontend Project Structure](./src/client/README.md#project-structure) and [Backend Project Structure](./src/server/README.md#project-structure) for more details on the respective `/client` and `/server/` organization.
